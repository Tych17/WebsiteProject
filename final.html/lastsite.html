        <h2>THE BEST FPS SERIES OF ALL TIME.</h2>
        
        <h3>About Halo:</h3>
        <p>Halo is a military science fiction first-person shooter video game franchise managed and developed by 343 Industries, a subsidiary of Xbox Game Studios. Halo was originally developed by Bungie Studios.</p> 
        <p>The series centers on an interstellar war between humanity and an alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. The Covenant, led by their religious leaders called the Prophets, worship an ancient civilization known as the Forerunners, who perished while defeating the parasitic Flood.</p>
        <p>The central focus of the franchise builds off the experiences of Master Chief John-117, one of a group of supersoldiers codenamed Spartans, and his artificial intelligence (AI) companion, Cortana.</p> 
        <p>Other characters, such as Noble Six from Halo: Reach, are also introduced in the series. The term "Halo" refers to the Halo Array: a group of immense, habitable, ring-shaped superweapons that were created by the Forerunners to destroy the Flood, but which the Covenant mistake for religious artifacts that, if activated, would transport them on a Great Journey to meet the Forerunners.</p>

I always would get into the story and the action, which definetely made it more impactful. I remembered finishing Halo 2 with my dad, and finding out Halo 3 was coming out that same night. I would get just as excited for every upcoming Halo game as before, because it's Halo...</p>
